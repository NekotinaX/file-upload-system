# Registration System with File Upload and Download Dashboard üìÇüöÄ

This is a **file upload and download system** where users can register, log in, and access a dashboard where they can upload files. Every registered user can download files, and the system tracks how many times each file has been downloaded in the database.

## Features ‚ú®

- **Registration**: Users can register via a form with data validation.
- **Login**: Users can log in with their username and password.
- **Dashboard**: Users can upload and download files.
- **Download Tracking**: The system tracks how many times each file has been downloaded.

## Setup Instructions üñ•Ô∏è

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NekotinaX/file-upload-system.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   The project is written in **PHP**. Ensure that you have a local PHP server installed.

3. **Set up the database**:
   Import the provided SQL file into your MySQL database to create the necessary tables. The SQL file is included in the project.

4. **Start the server**:
   Place the project folder in your directory. Access the project in your browser at `http://localhost/your-project-folder`.
